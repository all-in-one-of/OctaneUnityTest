This is a testbed repository that contains some examples of use of
[Octane for Unity].

The Octane for Unity plugin has been removed from the repository to avoid
potential license issues (actually I'm not sure if I can add the plugin to a
public repository). You have to manually install the plugin after cloning the
repository.
